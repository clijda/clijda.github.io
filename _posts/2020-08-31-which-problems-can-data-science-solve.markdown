You typically use data science or machine learning to answer five types of questions:

* How much or how many? (**regression**)
* Which category? (**classification**)
* Which group? (**clustering**)
* Is this weird? (**anomaly detection**)
* Which option should be taken? (**recommendation**)

Determine which of these questions you're asking and how answering it achieves your business goals.

If you want to automate data retrieval and/or store data in a structural way, then we talk about data engineering with its own set of solutions.
