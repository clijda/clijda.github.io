I"¬<p>You typically use data science or machine learning to answer five types of questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How much or how many? (<strong>regression</strong>)</li>
  <li>Which category? (<strong>classification</strong>)</li>
  <li>Which group? (<strong>clustering</strong>)</li>
  <li>Is this weird? (<strong>anomaly detection</strong>)</li>
  <li>Which option should be taken? (<strong>recommendation</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Determine which of these questions youâ€™re asking and how answering it achieves your business goals.</p>

<p>If you want to automate data retrieval and/or store data in a structural way, then we talk about data engineering with its own set of solutions.</p>
